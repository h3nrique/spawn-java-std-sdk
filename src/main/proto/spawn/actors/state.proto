// A revision is just a version number for a record in the snapshot table that stores the actors' state.
// When an actor has its snaphost timeout, it increments its internal revision number and saves it along with its internal data.
// Some of the persistence adapters can use this revision number to find the state of an Actor at a given point in time.
// As Actors in Spawn persist their internal data as snapshots from time to time a revision number may not indicate the state of a given change 
// but will most likely point to the exact time that a given actor's internal state was persisted into the database.
